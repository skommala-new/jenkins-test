# Two-Tier Kubernetes Application (Frontend + Backend)

This project sets up a simple two-tier web application on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. The frontend runs an NGINX web server, and the backend is a small HTTP echo service that returns a “Hello World” message.

## Prerequisites
- macOS with Docker Desktop, kubectl, and Minikube installed and working
- At least 4 GB of memory available for the cluster

## Steps to Run
1. Start the local cluster:
   ```bash
   ./setup-minikube-cluster.sh
   ```
2. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-application.sh
   ```
3. After deployment, run minikube service frontend-service --url.  
   Open that URL in your browser to view the app.

## What It Does
- Creates a Minikube cluster using the Docker driver  
- Deploys a backend (HTTP echo) service and a frontend (NGINX) that connects to it  
- Demonstrates basic Kubernetes deployments, services, and pod-to-pod communication

## Cleanup
To stop or remove the setup:
```bash
minikube stop
minikube delete
```

## Design Overview
The frontend and backend are deployed as separate Kubernetes Deployments with corresponding Services. The frontend NGINX container proxies API requests to the backend service using its internal service name (`backend-service`). This structure mimics a simple production-style setup where frontend and backend components communicate through stable service endpoints within the cluster.
